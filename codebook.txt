# Codebook
There are two data set, "tidy_data.txt" and "tidy_data_with_average.txt".
Use read.table("tidy_data.txt", header = TRUE) to read data.

# Variables
There are 68 variables in the dataset. The first two columns indicate the subject-activity pair.
The rest columns are average of the variables respectively.

# Data set features selection

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 
3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' 
to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered 
using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner 
frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then 
separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) 
using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived
in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the
magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean 
norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals 
producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, 
fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
  
e.g. tBodyAcc-XYZ
  
The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

e.g. mean(): Mean value ; std(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These 
are used on the angle() variable:

e.g. gravityMean ; tBodyAccMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'
